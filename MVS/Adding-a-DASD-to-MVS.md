# Adding a DASD to MVS 3.8J <!-- omit in toc -->
*written by roblthegreat*
  
Information on adding another DASD to MVS.  This will not cover performing an IOGEN.  We will use the existing IOGEN.  

If an IOGEN is needed, see the IOGEN document [to be written].

> **NOTE**  
> The 3390-3 is the largest supported DASD, but it doesnâ€™t support it very well. Even 3380s are not supported perfectly. 3350 is where MVS 3.8 wants to be ideally.

## Tell Hercules about the DASD.

Edit the hercules configuration file for the mainframe.  In a TK4- install, this will be the conf/tk4-.cnf file.

TK4- disk images are named "volumne_name.device_address".  For example, MVSRES on device 148 is located in the file dasd/mvsres.148.

In the tk4-.cnf, DASDs are defined in the following format:
```
device_id device_type dasd_image
```

For example, the MVSRES volume, on a model 3350 DASD, and located as an image file dasd/mvsres.148 would look like this in the conf/tk4-.cnf file.
```
0148 3350 dasd/mvsres.148
```

## Create the file to hold the DASD image
```bash
dasdinit -bz2 -a dasd/myvol.242 3350 MYVOL
```
Paramater | Definition
----------|-
-bz2      | designates this to be a compressed volume
-a        | instructs dasdinit to create alternate tracks .Most MVS utilities and programs will not function properly without the presence of the alternate tracks.
myvol.242 | filename of the DASD image on the Hercules host machine
3350      | Model of the DASD 
MYVOL     | Volume serial number as seen by MVS.

## IPL the Mainframe
IPL the mainframe and wait for MVS to finsish loading,
```
./mvs
```
## Take the volume offline
From the Hercules console vary the new drive offline (device id 242 in this example):
```
/v 242,offline
/s dealloc
```

## Format the volume
Login to TSO. Create a new JCL job using the following code as a template. The JCL code origniated from Jay Moseley's page on addind a DASD, referenced at the end of this document.

```jcl
//HERC01  JOB (1),ICKDSF,CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X
//ICKDSF EXEC PGM=ICKDSF,REGION=4096K
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN    DD  *
  INIT UNITADDRESS(<address>) NOVERIFY VOLID(<volser>) OWNER(HERCULES) -
               VTOC(0,1,<extent>)
/*
//
```
Variable | Definition
---------|-
address  | Device Address [242]
volser   | Volume Serial Number [MYVOL]
extent   | number of tracks to reserve for VTOC [40, should be fine for 3350]

Update the JCL to reflect the details of the DASD to format. Also, update the MSGCLASS to H to hold the output in the spool so that it can be reviewed.
```jcl
//HERC01  JOB (1),ICKDSF,CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H
//ICKDSF EXEC PGM=ICKDSF,REGION=4096K
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN    DD  *
  INIT UNITADDRESS(242) NOVERIFY VOLID(MYVOL) OWNER(HERCULES) -
               VTOC(0,1,40)
/*
//
```
Save and submit the job.

Back in the console, MVS will ask "ICK003D REPLY U TO ALTER VOLUME 242 CONTENTS, ELSE T".  

To confirm that you want to format the drive, enter reply in the console"
```
/r 00,U
```
Check the job output and confirm that the RC=0.

## Bring volume online and mount
From the console, we now need to bring the newly formatted volume online and mount it.
```
/v 242,online
/m 242,vol=(sl,MYVOL),USE=private
```
The volume should now be accessible at this point, but will we still need to make sure it is automatically mounted each time we IPL the mainfranme.

## Edit SYS1.PARMLIB(VATLST00)
In RFE, edit PDS member SYS1.PARMLIB(VATLST00), adding a new record at the bottom of the list, making certain you format the record the same as the existing records:

The parameters specified for each volume are:
Column(s) | Description
----------|-
1 - 6     | the volume serial number 
8         | 0 = permanently resident volumes; 1 = reserved volumes. Use 0 in most cases.
10        | The use attribute. 0 = STORAGE; 1 = PUBLIC; 2 = PRIVATE
12 - 19   |Denotes the device type.
21        | indicates whether the operator should be requested to mount the volume if it is not found during IPL.  In most cases you should specify N (for NO) in this column. (This refers back to the time when disks were removable and an operator had to manually install the disk packs.  "Just say 'N'o.")
23 - 71   | Used for comments

Save your changes.

## TO DO
* Need to add information on catalogs for  completeness.
* Write documentation on IOGEN.

Note that he inadvertently leaves off the '-a' paramater in for the dasdinit command initially which causes some errors, causing him to spend some time troubleshooting the issue.
