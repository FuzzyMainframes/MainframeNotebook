# Mainframe Notebook
This repository is desgined to be a collection of "how to" or "quick reference guides" for anyone venturing into the world of mainframes.   

Each of the "How To" articles will be focused on accomplishing a single task. For example, my first is a guide on how to add an additional DASD to MVS.

At the moment, there isn't much here, but will slowly be adding articles as time permits.
